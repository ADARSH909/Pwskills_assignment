    "What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with\n",
    "an example.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Both Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are mathematical functions used to describe the\n",
    "probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF is used for discrete random variables, while the PDF is used for continuous random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF assigns a probability value to each possible outcome of a discrete random variable. For example, let's consider the roll of a fair \n",
    "six-sided die. The PMF of this random variable would be:\n",
    "Outcome\t1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\n",
    "PMF\t1/6\t1/6\t1/6\t1/6\t1/6\t1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, the probability of rolling a 2 is 1/6, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF, on the other hand, assigns a probability density value to each possible value of a continuous random variable. Unlike the PMF, \n",
    "the PDF does not give the probability of a specific value occurring, but rather the probability of a value falling within a certain range. \n",
    "For example, let's consider the height of adult males in a certain population. The PDF of this random variable would be a smooth curve that \n",

    "What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a mathematical function that describes the cumulative probability distribution of a random variable, \n",
    "whether it is continuous or discrete. It is defined as the probability that a random variable X takes on a value less than or equal to a certain \n",

    "where F(x) represents the probability that X is less than or equal to x.\n",

    "For example, let's consider a simple example of the CDF of a discrete random variable. Suppose we roll a fair six-sided die. The CDF for this \n",

    "PMF\t1/6\t1/6\t1/6\t1/6\t1/6\t1/6\n",
    "CDF\t1/6\t1/3\t1/2\t2/3\t5/6\t1\n",
    "\n",
    "This table shows both the PMF and the CDF of the random variable. The PMF assigns a probability value to each outcome, while the CDF shows the\n",
    "probability of getting a value less than or equal to a certain threshold. For example, the CDF value at x=3 is 1/2, meaning that the probability \n",
    "of getting a value less than or equal to 3 is 1/2.\n",
