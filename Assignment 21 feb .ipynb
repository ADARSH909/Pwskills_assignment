    " What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "Web scraping refers to the process of automatically extracting information or data from web pages using computer programs or scripts.\n",
    "The extracted data can be saved in a structured format, such as a CSV file, spreadsheet or database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is used for a variety of purposes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data collection: Web scraping is used to collect large amounts of data from multiple websites, which can then be analyzed for\n",
    "    various purposes such as market research, competitor analysis, and trend analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Price monitoring: Web scraping is used by businesses to monitor the prices of their products on competitor websites. This \n",
    "    helps businesses adjust their own pricing strategy in real-time to remain competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Content aggregation: Web scraping is used to aggregate content from multiple sources to create a comprehensive database. \n",
    "    This can be useful for news and media websites that want to provide their readers with up-to-date information from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three areas where web scraping is commonly used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    E-commerce: Web scraping is widely used in the e-commerce industry to collect data on products, prices, and customer reviews\n",
    "    from various e-commerce websites. This data can then be used to improve pricing strategies, product offerings, and customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Academic research: Web scraping is used in academic research to collect data from various online sources, such as social media\n",
    "    platforms, news websites, and government databases. This data can be used to analyze trends, conduct surveys, and perform sentiment\n",
    "    analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Marketing and advertising: Web scraping is used by marketing and advertising agencies to collect data on customer behavior, \n",

    "What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "There are several methods used for web scraping, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Manual Scraping: Manual scraping involves manually copying and pasting data from a website into a spreadsheet or database.\n",
    "    While this method is straightforward, it can be time-consuming and impractical for scraping large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Regular Expressions: Regular expressions are a powerful tool for searching and manipulating text. Web scraping using regular \n",
    "    expressions involves using pattern matching to extract specific data from a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "    HTML Parsing: HTML parsing involves using an HTML parser, such as Beautiful Soup, to extract data from the HTML code of a web page.\n",
    "    HTML parsing is a more sophisticated method of web scraping that can handle complex web pages and extract data with more accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Web Scraping Libraries: There are several web scraping libraries available for popular programming languages such as Python and Ruby,\n",
    "    including Scrapy and Nokogiri. These libraries simplify the process of web scraping by providing a set of tools and functions for \n",
    "    extracting data from web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "    API Scraping: Some websites offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access data directly from the\n",
    "    website's servers. API scraping involves sending requests to these APIs and receiving data in a structured format such as JSON or XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Headless Browsers: Headless browsers are browser instances that can be controlled using programming languages, such as Puppeteer for\n",
    "    Node.js. Web scraping using headless browsers involves simulating a user browsing a website and extracting data from the resulting pages."
