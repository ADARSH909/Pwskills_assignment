    "Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you might choose one over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ordinal Encoding: In ordinal encoding, categorical values are assigned numerical labels based on their ordinal relationship, meaning there is a meaningful order or ranking among the categories. For example, assigning 1, 2, 3 to the categories \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Label Encoding: Label encoding is a more general encoding technique where each category is assigned a unique integer label without implying any specific order. For example, converting \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue\" to 1, 2, 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a dataset with the \"Education Level\" feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ordinal Encoding: High School (1), Bachelor's (2), Master's (3), PhD (4).\n",
    "    Label Encoding: High School (1), Bachelor's (2), Master's (3), PhD (4).\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Choose:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Choose Ordinal Encoding when the categorical values have a clear order or hierarchy, and this order is meaningful for the model.\n",
    "    Choose Label Encoding when there is no inherent order among the categories, or when the order is not relevant to the analysis."

    "Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, the labels are assigned based on the mean of the target variable for each category. This encoding is especially useful when dealing with ordinal categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a dataset with the \"Education Level\" feature and the target variable being \"Salary.\" You want to encode \"Education Level\" based on the mean salary for each education level:\n",
    "\n",
    "    High School: Mean Salary 40,000\n",
    "    Bachelor's: Mean Salary 60,000\n",
    "    Master's: Mean Salary 80,000\n",
    "    PhD: Mean Salary 100,000\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the encoding would be: High School (1), Bachelor's (2), Master's (3), PhD (4).\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding when the ordinal feature has a clear relationship with the target variable, and you want to capture this relationship in the encoding."
