    "Q1. Purpose of Grid Search CV in Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Purpose:\n",
    "        Grid Search Cross-Validation is a hyperparameter tuning technique used to find the best combination of hyperparameter values for a machine learning model.\n",
    "        It exhaustively searches through a specified subset of hyperparameter values, evaluating the model's performance using cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    How it works:\n",
    "        It creates a grid of hyperparameter combinations.\n",
    "        For each combination, it trains the model using cross-validation and evaluates its performance.\n",
    "        The combination with the best performance is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Difference between Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Grid Search CV:\n",
    "        Searches through all possible combinations of hyperparameter values specified in a grid.\n",
    "        Computationally expensive for large search spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Randomized Search CV:\n",
    "        Randomly samples a fixed number of hyperparameter combinations from the specified search space.\n",
    "        More efficient for large search spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Data Leakage and its Problem in Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data Leakage:\n",
    "        Data leakage occurs when information outside the training data is used to create a model, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates.\n",
    "    Problem:\n",
    "        It can result in models that perform well in training but poorly in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "        Leads to inflated performance metrics and misleading insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Preventing Data Leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strategies:\n",
    "        Strict separation of training and testing data.\n",
    "        Feature engineering should be done using only training data.\n",
    "        Be cautious with time-dependent data to avoid future information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Definition:\n",
    "        A confusion matrix is a table that describes the performance of a classification model.\n",
    "        It compares predicted labels with true labels and categorizes outcomes into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Precision and Recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Precision:\n",
    "        Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.\n",
    "        Precision = TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Recall:\n",
    "        Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all the actual positives.\n",
    "        Recall = TP / (TP + FN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Interpreting a Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Types of Errors:\n",
    "        False Positive (Type I Error): Model predicts positive when it's actually negative.\n",
    "        False Negative (Type II Error): Model predicts negative when it's actually positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Common Metrics from a Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Accuracy:\n",
    "        (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)\n",
    "    F1 Score:\n",
    "        2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Relationship Between Accuracy and Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Accuracy:\n",
    "        Overall correctness of the model.\n",
    "        Not always a good metric, especially in imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Using Confusion Matrix to Identify Biases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Examine Class Imbalances:\n",
    "        Check if the model is biased toward predicting the majority class.\n",
    "    Analyze Misclassifications:\n",
    "        Look at the types of errors made by the model and assess if there are biases or limitations in handling specific classes or scenarios."
