    "Q1. Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization\n",
    "penalties in the linear regression cost function. It is designed to address some of the limitations of Lasso and Ridge \n",
    "regression when dealing with high-dimensional datasets and multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences from other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Combines L1 and L2 regularization, providing a compromise between the variable selection of Lasso and the shrinkage of Ridge.\n",
    "    Includes two hyperparameters (αα and λλ) to control the balance between the L1 and L2 penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Choosing Optimal Regularization Parameters for Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "The optimal values of the regularization parameters (αα and λλ) in Elastic Net Regression are typically chosen through\n",
    "cross-validation. Cross-validation helps in evaluating the model's performance for different combinations of αα and λλ values. \n",
    "Grid search or randomized search can be used to systematically explore the parameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Advantages and Disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Combines benefits of both Lasso and Ridge, allowing for variable selection while handling multicollinearity.\n",
    "    Suitable for datasets with a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Requires tuning of two parameters, which may complicate the modeling process.\n",
    "    Can still face challenges with highly correlated features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Common Use Cases for Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "    High-dimensional datasets with a large number of features.\n",
    "    Situations where there is multicollinearity among predictor variables.\n",
    "    Regression problems where variable selection is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Interpreting Coefficients in Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "Interpreting coefficients in Elastic Net Regression is similar to standard linear regression. Non-zero coefficients\n",
    "indicate the importance of corresponding features in the model. The magnitude of the coefficients reflects the strength of \n",
    "the relationship between the predictor variable and the target variable. A coefficient of zero means that the feature is effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "excluded from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Handling Missing Values in Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "Before applying Elastic Net Regression, missing values in the dataset should be addressed. Common methods include\n",
    "imputation (replacing missing values with estimated values) or removing rows or columns with missing values. The choice depends\n",
    "on the nature of the missing data and the impact on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Using Elastic Net Regression for Feature Selection:\n",
    "Elastic Net naturally performs feature selection due to its combination of L1 and L2 penalties. The L1 penalty encourages sparsity,\n",
    "driving some coefficients to exactly zero and excluding corresponding features from the model. By adjusting the αα parameter,\n",
    "one can control the strength of the L1 penalty and, consequently, the degree of feature selection.\n"
